Building open-source AI assistants 
using HuggingFace Chat Assistants.

Submission Guidelines: Open-Source AI Assistants
Objective: This report aims to document your journey in building an open-source AI assistant using Hugging Face Chat Assistants. It should showcase your understanding of prompt engineering, user-centric design, and strategic planning for AI product development.

Submission Format: 
Please submit your report as a single markdown(.md) file. The report should be clearly structured with headings and subheadings.

Report Sections:
1. AI Assistant Overview
* Assistant Name: Give your AI assistant a clear and descriptive name.
* Purpose & Target Audience: Clearly define the primary purpose of your AI assistant. Who is it designed to help, and what specific problems does it aim to solve?
* Key Features: List the main functionalities and capabilities of your AI assistant.
2. System Prompt Design and Justification
This is a critical section of your report. Your system prompt is the core instruction set for your AI assistant, defining its persona, behavior, and constraints.
* Full System Prompt: Provide the complete text of your system prompt.
* Justification and Impact Analysis:
  * Breakdown of Elements: Explain each major component or instruction within your system prompt. 
For example, if you define a persona, explain why that persona is appropriate for your assistant's purpose. If you set specific tone guidelines, explain the reasoning.
  * Design Choices: Justify why you wrote the prompt the way you did. Consider:
    * What problem does each part of the prompt address?
    * How does it guide the AI towards desired behaviors and away from undesirable ones?
    * What constraints did you impose, and why?
    * How does it enhance the user experience?
  * Anticipated Impact: Discuss the expected impact of your system prompt on the AI assistant's performance, user interactions, and overall effectiveness. How does your prompt contribute to achieving the assistant's stated purpose?
  * Iteration & Refinement (Optional but Recommended): Briefly describe any iterations or refinements you made to your system prompt during the development process and why those changes were necessary.
3. User Reviews and Feedback Analysis
Gather feedback from at least 10 unique users who have interacted with your AI assistant. This feedback is crucial for understanding real-world performance and identifying areas for improvement.
* Methodology: Briefly describe how you collected user reviews (e.g., direct messaging, survey form, in-person testing).
* Review Collection: For each user, include:
  * User ID (can be anonymized)
  * Date of interaction
  * Summary of their interaction (what they used the assistant for)
  * Their overall satisfaction rating (e.g., 1-5 stars)
  * Their comments and observations.
* Feedback Factors (What to ask users about): When collecting reviews, encourage users to provide feedback on the following aspects:
  * Accuracy: Was the information provided by the assistant correct and relevant to their query?
  * Clarity & Coherence: Were the assistant's responses easy to understand and well-structured?
  * Usefulness/Helpfulness: Did the assistant effectively help them achieve their goal or answer their question?
  * Tone & Persona: Did the assistant's tone feel appropriate for its purpose? Was its persona consistent?
  * Response Speed: How quickly did the assistant respond?
  * Error Handling/Fallback: How well did the assistant handle unexpected or unclear queries? Did it provide helpful fallback responses?
  * Engagement: Did the conversation feel natural and engaging?
  * Ease of Use: How easy was it to interact with the assistant?
  * Bias/Fairness (if applicable): Did they notice any biases in the assistant's responses?
  * Overall Experience: Would they use this assistant again? What did they like most/least?
* Analysis of Feedback:
  * Summary of Key Findings: Identify common themes, strengths, and weaknesses from the collected reviews.
  * Quantitative Metrics (if applicable): Present any aggregated ratings (e.g., average satisfaction score).
  * Insights Gained: What did you learn from the user feedback that you wouldn't have discovered otherwise?
  * Actionable Takeaways: Based on the feedback, what are the top 3-5 areas for improvement?
4. Future Roadmap
Outline your plans for the evolution and improvement of your AI assistant.
* Short-Term Goals (Next 1 week): What immediate improvements or new features do you plan to implement based on your initial development and user feedback?
* Mid-Term Goals (Next 2-4 weeks): What are your aspirations for your AI assistant in the near future? Consider expanding its capabilities, integrating with other tools, or refining its core functionality.
* Long-Term Vision (Beyond 4 weeks): Where do you see your AI assistant in the long run? What grander problems could it solve, or what impact could it have?
5. Plan to Increase User Adoption
Describe your strategy for attracting and retaining users for your AI assistant.
* Initial User Acquisition: How will you make your AI assistant known to its target audience? (e.g., sharing on social media, community forums, direct outreach).
* Value Proposition Communication: How will you clearly communicate the unique value and benefits of your assistant to potential users?
* Marketing & Promotion (Low-cost/Open-source focused): Brainstorm creative, low-cost ways to promote your open-source assistant.
* Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement: How will you continue to gather user feedback and iterate on your assistant to ensure its continued relevance and appeal?
* Community Engagement (if applicable): If your assistant is truly open-source, how will you foster a community around it for contributions and wider adoption?
Evaluation Criteria:
Reports will be evaluated based on:
* Clarity and completeness of the system prompt justification.
* Depth of analysis of user feedback.
* Feasibility and vision of the future roadmap.
* Creativity and practicality of the user adoption plan.
* Overall coherence, organization, and presentation of the report.
